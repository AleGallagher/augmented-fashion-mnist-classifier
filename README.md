# Augmented Fashion MNIST Classifier

This project implements a neural network with Keras to classify grayscale images of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It includes data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flipping to increase model robustness and reduce overfitting.
The main keys of the project are:

* Neural Network models
* Keras
* Data Augmentation
